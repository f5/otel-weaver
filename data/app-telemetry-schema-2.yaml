# The section below outlines the telemetry schema for a service or application.
# This schema details all the metrics, logs, and spans specifically generated
# by that service or application.
#
# Note: Frameworks or libraries linked with the application that produce OTel
# telemetry data might also have their own telemetry schema, detailing the
# metrics, logs, and spans they generate locally.
