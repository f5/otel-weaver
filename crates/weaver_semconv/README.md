# Semantic Convention Catalog

## Introduction

This crate provides serialization and deserialization support for YAML files
adhering to the semantic convention (semconv catalog), as well as a set of
methods to resolve references between different semconv catalogs.

See [semantic convention YAML language](https://github.com/open-telemetry/build-tools/blob/main/semantic-conventions/syntax.md)
for more details on the syntax.
